## üöÄ Setup and Installation

**IMPORTANT:** For `tensorflow` and `pmdarima` to install correctly on Windows, you **MUST** have the **"Desktop development with C++" workload** installed via the Visual Studio Build Tools. Download from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and select this workload during installation.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable, or create the `stock_forecasting_project` directory).

2.  **Install Python 3.10 (Recommended for TensorFlow/pmdarima compatibility):**
    If you don't have Python 3.10 installed, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31012/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31012/). During installation, ensure you check "Add Python 3.10 to PATH".

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) **as an Administrator**.
    Navigate to your project root directory: `cd D:\Internship project`

    Then, create the virtual environment using Python 3.10 (adjust path as per your installation):
    ```bash
    "C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe" -m venv venv_py310
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username. Common path alternatives: `C:\Python310\python.exe` or `C:\Program Files\Python310\python.exe`)

    Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    .\venv_py310\Scripts\activate
    ```
    (You should see `(venv_py310)` at the start of your terminal prompt).

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With the virtual environment active, install all required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ How to Run the Project

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, run the main script from your project root directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script orchestrates the entire pipeline: data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Output files (data, models, visuals, reports) will be saved in their respective directories.
